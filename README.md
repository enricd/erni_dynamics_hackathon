## Challenge description üíª

Three days to achieve the goal‚Äã  ‚è≥

- Build and program a robot that is able to move through an obstacle course as fast as possible.‚Äã
- Do that remote controlled over the internet by someone else from outside your office.‚Äã
- Work with ERNI quality.‚Äã
- Be visible and let others know about your project.
- Team with most points wins. Maximum score is 20.000 points.‚Äã‚Äã

### Usability 
You might be good, but did you consider the users?

Which robot performs best when operated remotely via internet?

### Technology
Tight timeframes are no excuse not to be excellent.

Our tech jury will have a brief look at the requirements coverage and review your technical design. Can you impress them?

### Beauty
Can you win the hearts of the audience?

Which robot gets the most votes from our heterogenic global audience?
# Welcome to ERNI Dynamics!

Hi! we are the **ERNI Dynamics** group, in this document we are going to explain step by step the process to do the set up, also we are going to explain how to build the hardware!


# Hardware

We are using the picar-x kit, in this kit we have what is necessary to make a programable vehicle.

To achieve a satisfactory assembly we must follow the steps indicated in the previous images. You can modify the original parts if you want to optimize the vehicle, perhaps new wheels?

We decided to build our own bigger wheels, so our robot can be faster with the same motors. To implement them, we flipped the motor position, so the rear axis position is further away from the front wheels. This reduces the angle of the chasis, so front wheels have a good contact with the ground and the line sensor still have some clearance.
