# Welcome to ERNI Dynamics!

Hi! we are the **ERNI Dynamics** group, in this document we are going to explain step by step the process to do the set up, also we are going to explain how to build the hardware!


# Hardware

We are using the picar-x kit, in this kit we have what is necessary to make a programable vehicle.

To achieve a satisfactory assembly we must follow the steps indicated in the previous images. You can modify the original parts if you want to optimize the vehicle, perhaps new wheels?

We decided to build our own bigger wheels, so our robot can be faster with the same motors. To implement them, we flipped the motor position, so the rear axis position is further away from the front wheels. This reduces the angle of the chasis, so front wheels have a good contact with the ground and the line sensor still have some clearance.
